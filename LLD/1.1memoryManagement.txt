there are two ways object of a class can be created

1) stack memory
2) heap memory

stack memory is static memory allocation -> its created compile-time and manged by compiler during run-time
whereas
heap memory is dynamic memory allocation -> its allocated during run-time and should be managed by programmer itself


diff
1) 
stack memory can be called only in scope
heap memory can be called anywhere in the programm

2) 
stack memory is managed by compiler
heap memory is managed by programmer

//creation
stack memory way to create object
Myclass obj;

heap memory way to create object
Myclass* obj = new Myclass();
delete obj; // freed the allocated memory

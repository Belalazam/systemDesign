The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It's commonly used when the exact type of object to create depends on some condition at runtime.

public interface Vehicle {
    void drive();
}


public class Car implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving a car");
    }
}

public class Bike implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Riding a bike");
    }
}

public class Truck implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving a truck");
    }
}


public class VehicleFactory {
    // Factory method to create a Vehicle
    public Vehicle createVehicle(String type) {
        if (type == null) {
            return null;
        }
        switch (type.toLowerCase()) {
            case "car":
                return new Car();
            case "bike":
                return new Bike();
            case "truck":
                return new Truck();
            default:
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown vehicle type: " + type);
        }
    }
}





public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        VehicleFactory vehicleFactory = new VehicleFactory();

        Vehicle vehicle1 = vehicleFactory.createVehicle("car");
        vehicle1.drive();  // Output: Driving a car

        Vehicle vehicle2 = vehicleFactory.createVehicle("bike");
        vehicle2.drive();  // Output: Riding a bike

        Vehicle vehicle3 = vehicleFactory.createVehicle("truck");
        vehicle3.drive();  // Output: Driving a truck
    }
}







The Factory Pattern is about creating the right object at runtime based on a given input or condition


Abstract Factory Pattern -> we hide the Object creation logic, while implementing factory pattern

lets Start with Class And Object

anything which has four wheel , can carry more than 1 person and can commute between A place-> B place 
we call it a car  

and bmw, ferrari, buggati, maruti, suzuki are cars

SO HERE bmw, ferrari, buggati, maruti, suzki are object, and class is car

ferrari bmw, ferrari, buggati, maruti, suzki  is an Instance or example of car


so by defination ->
object are instance of the class
class are blueprint for creating objects

this is how class and object are represented in c++

class Car{
private:
    int enginePower;
    int comfortScore;  {these are called, attirbutes or memeber  variables}
    int totalMielage;
public:
	
	{this is called constructor}
    Car(int comfortScore, int totalMielage, int enginePower){
            this->comfortScore = comfortScore;
            this->totalMielage = totalMielage;  
            this->enginePower = enginePower;
    }

	
	{these are called memeber function or methods}
    int getComfortScore()
    {
        return comfortScore;
    }

    int  getTotalMielage()
    {
        return totalMielage;
    }

    int getEnginePower()
    {
        return  enginePower;
    }
};

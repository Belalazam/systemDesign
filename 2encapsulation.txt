same as medicine capsule, a outer coverting and then inside medicine

what is encapsulation->
practice of buning data into single unit

a class is an example of encapsulation->
memeber variables + member function = class (single unit)

lets talk about data hiding

we have 3 access specifier-> 

public -> when you define something public, its for every one
everyone means->  (same class true), (derived class true), (outside class true)


protected  ->     (same class true), (derived class true), (outside class false)

protected  ->     (same class true), (derived class false), (outside class false)



let say in our company which is again ("helping truth")

we have a web app for our company
in that web app
we have (database file), (utils file), (database file for friend) 
in database file  we have code which matches and save username and password
while in (util file) we have some logic, like name should not have special char etc

we will choose datbase file to be private , cause its confidentials
and util file to be public, so that everyone can user
we will choose (database file for friend) to be protected , which is derived class from database file)



when hacker comes and try to run script in out code, he can only access util file, which will not give us any damage

what is abstraction?
data hiding is called abstraction


let say in our company ("helping truth")
we hired some intern, and those intern has very little knowledge.

they said they have some names, and wanted to know whether these name have been ever helped
and what is the total money they are helped with. 

so lets help them



class HelpedInformation{
    public:
        int getTotalAmountHelped(string name)
        {
             if(name == "suresh")
             {
                return 100;
             }
             else if(name == "david")
             {
                return 400;
             }
             return -1;
        }

        int getNumberOfPeopleHelped(string name)
        {
            if(name == "suresh")
             {
                return 3;
             }
             else if(name == "david")
             {
                return 8;
             }
             return -1;
        }
};
